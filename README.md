# Dowd's Moving and Storage
157 Throckmorton Ave., Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

The Dowd family, all pioneers of Mill Valley, established Dowd’s Fashion Stable in 1892. The company utilized both motorized vehicles and horses, and maintained an elegant rig which seated 12 people. In addition to hauling material, the firm rented horses and burros. The burros were hired out at the rate of 25 cents per hour or $1.50 per day for trips to the top of Mt. Tamalpais or up Cascade Canyon. 

In 1910, the building which housed the stables burned to the ground. The following year, it was replaced with a new building which looked much the same as the previous one. Horses were replaced with motor trucks in 1919, and by the 1930s the Dowd’s business had been reinvented as a storage, hauling, and moving company. 

In the 1950s, the building materials business was discontinued the concentration shifted to the development of the moving and storage enterprises. It was likely at this time the name changed to Dowd’s Moving and Storage. 

The Dowds also ran a mortuary on Madrona Street from 1905 to 1919, had a quarry in Cascade Canyon, and sold building supplies on the corner of Madrona and Lovell. The business was run for years by two of the Mrs. Dowds. In 1973 the firm was sold to the two women.

The Dowd’s building burned down on June 18, 1984, “when a $1 million fire destroyed it and an adjacent building”, and 157 Throckmorton has remained an empty lot ever since (Source: [Mill Valley Patch: Then and Now](https://patch.com/california/millvalley/then-now-dowds-storage)).
